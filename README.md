# The Ruby Style Guide

This style guide is adapted from the [Ruby Style Guide](https://github.com/bbatsov/ruby-style-guide) originally authored by [Bozhidar Batsov](https://github.com/bbatsov). He says:

> This Ruby style guide recommends best practices so that real-world Ruby programmers can write code that can be maintained by other real-world Ruby programmers. A style guide that reflects real-world usage gets used, and a style guide that holds to an ideal that has been rejected by the people it is supposed to help risks not getting used at all &ndash; no matter how good it is.

I agree. Every effective team of which I've been a member or observer has utilized a style guide of some sort. Typically, they're a mish-mash of rules cobbled from personal experience, best practices suggessted from the larger community, and team consensus.

You should adhere to the rules and styles documented in this stlye guide for all of your Ruby and Rails projects while in the Ada classroom. If you commit code that deviates from the recommendations in this document, provide extensive reasoning in your commit message. Explain why your code is the _exception that proves the rule_.

If you come upon a situation in which there are no applicable rules in this document, talk with your team/pair to determine the best structure and formatting. Once you're happy with your solution, open a pull request adding the recommendation, along with your reasoning, to this style guide. In this way, our style guide can grow over time into a reflection of our culture and values as a team.
